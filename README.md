### Overview
This repository holds three different sorting algorithms for integer arrays.
- bubble, quick and insertion sorts
**Build:** The build package is located in the actions tab and can be downloaded from there

### Installation
1. Download package from latest workflow run (located under artifacts) `python-packages`
2. extract .zip to your desired directory
3. open a new shell terminal from that director and run `pip install .\sort_lib-1.0.tar.gz`

### Usage
Once installed, you can import the module into any python file or interpreter
`import int_sort`
or if you only need one algorithm for all your sorting needs:
`from int_sort import bubble`
the int_sort module contains the following sorts
*NOTE: All sorts take exactly one argument, a list*
- `quick` quick sort
- `selection` selection sort
- `bubble` bubble sort'

### Workflow
The repository is set up to lint, test and build on push and pull requests. This means that any changes made must pass Black and Flake8 linters as well as a couple different unit tests (if sorting algorithms are altered or new ones are added)
*Note: If you are pushing from the command line, a pre-commit check is run and your code will be automatically sent through Black, this requires you to add your file to the commit again, but it will allow you to forgo the headache of watching failed test in the git-hub actions tab*
- Linting with Flake8 and Black (Ubuntu-latest)
- Unit Tests with Pytest (verified on Windows-latest, MacOs-latest, Ubuntu-Latest)
- Build (verified on Windows-latest, MacOs-latest, Ubuntu-Latest) ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/ForrestSwift/inhouse-operations-pytest/Sort%20Lib)
